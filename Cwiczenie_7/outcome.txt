A crucial role was played here by the U.S. Department of Commerce under Milton Gilbert where ideas from Kuznets were embedded into institutions. GDP captures the amount a country produces, including goods and services produced for other nations' consumption, therefore exports are added. Meanwhile, if a person buys replacement auto parts to install them on their car, those are counted towards the GDP. This would make the use of GDP more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets. It is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on GDP every quarter, allowing trends to be seen quickly. For example, many environmentalists argue that GDP is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment. Although a high or rising level of GDP is often associated with increased economic and social progress, the opposite sometimes occurs. A 2020 study found that "poor regions' GDP grows faster by attracting more polluting production after connection to China's expressway system. In 2019, Erik Brynjolfsson and Avinash Collis argued that GDP does not reflect the growing value of many digital goods because they have zero price. Along with several coauthors, they proposed an alternative approach, GDP-B, which is based on measuring the benefits of goods and services, rather than their price or cost.
